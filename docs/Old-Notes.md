# NOTES

## Release procedure

Create a branch "prerel" or "prerel-number" to test pre-releases.
Just push to create artifacts that can be downloaded, or tag with
"x.y.z-dev" or "x.y.z-rcN" or 'x.y.z-pre' for create pre-releases.

Once ready, merge everything to main.  And commit. The final commit message
will be used for the release text body.

Create a tag with a "x.y.z" or "x.y.z-rel".  This will be the release
name.  Once pushed to github, it will automatically create the release.

To delete tags use:

- `git tag -d tagname` : deletes locally
- `git push origin --delete tagname` : deletes remotely

## TODO

- [x] sphinx docs
- [x] handle partial starting years.


## Ideas for SPA

* Pre-loads
  - New tab on SPA
  - User can select other pre-load profiles
  - User can edit pre-load profiles
* Component tabs
  - Build screen lets you specify additional component tabs
  - Add a Button to add component tabs
* Additional pricing files
  - edit current pricing files
  - add more pricing files
* authentication

Libraries:

- edit preloads and additions
  - [tabulator](https://tabulator.info/)
  - [handsontable](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable)
- for simplicity, use [bottle](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle)
  - [cork - authentication](https://github.com/FedericoCeratto/bottle-cork) ... probably
    requires beaker
  - [beaker - sessions](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle-beaker)
  - [jwt](https://github.com/agile4you/bottle-jwt/)
